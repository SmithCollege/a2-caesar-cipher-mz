## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
My favorite part was running all my tests and having them pass finally.

What was most challenging about this assignment?
I did not understand the assignment at first which obviously made working on it difficult. However, after figuring out how DynamicArray was supposed to be used in the CaesarCipher class, the rest of the assignment made much more sense.

General comments on your experience with this assignment:
The first week working on this asssignment was an absolute nightmare but it has just taught me to go to office hours and seek help from the professor much earlier in the process to avoid wasting time working on the assignment incorrectly.
